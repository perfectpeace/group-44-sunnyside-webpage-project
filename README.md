      left: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 50vh;
      opacity: 1;
      z-index: 1;
      background: transparent;
      transition: 0.5s;
   }

   .navbar {
      position: relative;
      background: #fff;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      width: 100%;
      height: auto;
      border-radius: 5px;
      padding: 20px;
   }
   .navbar::after {
      content: "";
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      right: 0;
      width: 100px;
      height: 50px;
      background: var(--White);
      transform: rotate(-51deg) translate(4%, 0%);
      z-index: -1;
      border-radius: 10px;
   }
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
